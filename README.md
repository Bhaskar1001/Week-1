# Week-1
This project develops a Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System using Machine Learning. It predicts the best crop and fertilizer based on environmental factors like Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. The system helps farmers make informed decisions to optimize crop yield and minimize fertilizer usage.
